## What is tenet.js

**tenet.js** is a pseudo compiler for Javascript with TypeScript.

It enables typenames for variables such as _int, double, string_ and _bool_.

**tenet.js**  files are created with the **`.tjs`** extension.

## How to run

Make sure you have _Node.js_ and _TypeScript_ installed.

To compile **test.tjs** run `node lexer.js test.tjs`

This command will create a `test.ts` and a `test.js` file. You can do whatever you want with them! ðŸ¥³
+ **tenet.js**  always keeps the same file name.
+ Error handling is done by the TypeScript compiler.
