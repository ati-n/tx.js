# Transplant.js

<br/>

When I first heard about TypeScript, I was very excited, because I am so used to declaring types for everything in C/C++/Java etc.
I thought that Javascript is very cool because of its flexibility, but gives a lot of headache when you try to debug where the hell something became null or undefined.

When I was getting to know TypeScript, immediately I got confused with the type syntax.

`let x: number`...what?

What is this syntax? I know Javascript uses this syntax under the hood, but is it really... appealing?

I didn't like it. I thought `int x` would be a million times better, get rid of that wierd syntax come on..  
The syntax would be ~~almost~~ like Java...

## Explicit types

If you know TypeScript, you're already good to go.
Tx **is** TypeScript code with classic _"types on the left‚Äù-style declarations_ and the type annotations you know and love from other languages.

Here's an example. This code is written in TypeScript...

```typescript
function greet(person: string, date: Date) {
  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);
}
```

Would be written like this in Tx:

```typescript
void greet(str person, Date date) {
  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);
}
```

Well, this doesn't look much.. But this is not what Tx is only doing!

# Everyday types

Types appear in many places in TypeScript and so do in Tx.

When you would declare something with a type in eg. Java, you do that in Tx. When it's rather confusing to use a type declaration (for example TypeScript union types before declaring a variable, _more on that later_), Tx follows TypeScript's syntax.

---

### Primitives
<br>

Tx primitives are `int`, `double`, `str`, `bool`, `big` and `sym`.

TypeScript (and Javascript) `number` is a **double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754)**, so every number is basically a float.
In Tx you can still choose if you want `int` or `double`, why is that? ~~Because now you can really distinguish between integers and floating point numbers!~~   At first I only wanted to use `int` for every number, but that would've been so incorrect grammatically, so I added `double`. These are nonetheless the same, just here for convenience.

The other primitives are very straight forward, TypeScript's `string` is called `str` in Tx, `boolean` is `bool`, `biging` is `big` and `symbol` is `sym`.

The other two Javascript primitives `undefined` and `null` don't have special syntaxes.  
Though not primitives, TypeScript added a couple more types: `unknown`, `never` and `void`. These don't have special syntaxes either and you can't use them as left-style types. (Except for function return types. _More on that later_)


### Type Annotations for Variables

<br>

When you delcare a variable in TypeScript, you would do something like this:

```typescript
let myName: string = "Joey";
```

This is though considered a 'bad practice' and the `: string` isn't needed, because TypeScript tries to _infer_ the types in the code.

Still it would be _great_ if all variable types would've got their annotations without too much typing.

Let's look at Tx:

```python
str myName = 'Joey';
```

This code compiles to the previous TypeScript code!  
If you want a constant variable, just type `const` before the type:

```c#
const int myNum = 56;
```

This will become

```typescript
// This is TypeScript
const myNum: number = 56;
```

### Arrays

<br/>

Tx's array types are written as `int[]` for `[ 1, 2, 3 ]` . You can use the other syntax `Array<int>`, this means the same.
```java
int[] myList = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
Array<obj> duelMasters = [{ name: "Joey", ace: "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" },
                          { name: "Yugi", ace: "Dark Magician" }]
```


### Functions

<br>

There are multiple options and ways to write functions in TypeScript.  
Tx.js tries to follow languages like Java once again, so the most common syntax is `returnType`+`functionName`+`(params)`.

#### Parameter Type Annotations
```typescript
void beerProfile(str name, int age, bool isAdult = false, Array<str> favDrinks) {
  // ...
}
```
#### Return Type Annotation
```typescript
// Tx.js
void greet(str name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// TypeScript
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

#### Anonymous (or Arrow) functions

Remember, that the variable's type is `Function`, not the return type of the function!  
```typescript
// Tx.js
Function hello = void (str name) {
  // ...
}

// TypeScript
let hello: Function = function(name: string): void {
  // ...
}
```

Arrow functions keep the TypeScript syntax:
```typescript
// Tx.js
const str[] beers = ["Heineken", "Calsberg", "Hoegaarden"];

beers.forEach( (beer): str => {
  console.log("Can I buy you a " + beer + "?");
});
```


### Object Types

<br>

Here is an example of Tx keeping the TypeScript syntax format, when we annotated the `sum` parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - both are `int` types.

```typescript
int add(sum: { int x, int y }) {
    return sum.x + sum.y;
}
add({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

You already saw in the very first example, that Tx uses the left-side type syntax in function parameters, but when the parameter is an object it's just better to not go into something like ~~`add({int x, int y} sum)`~~. Looks ugly and confusing.

Optional properties are the same in Tx and in TypeScript (use `?`)

```typescript
str yourName(obj: { str first, str last? }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
yourName({ first: "Joey" });
yourName({ first: "Yugi", last: "Moto" });
```

### Union types

<br>

TypeScript's union types were very controversial for me when I first learned about them. What's the point of strong typing if you can dodge it and _still have multiple types_ ?

I kept TypeScript's syntax format, because ~~`(int | str id)`~~ looks confusing and I rather use **Type Aliases** instead (see below).

```typescript
void printLicensePlate(id: int | str) {
  console.log("Your License plate is: " + id);
}
// Both OK
printLicensePlate(9021007);
printLicensePlate(`CA-6707S`);
```

### Type Aliases

<br>

```typescript
type Coordinate = {
    double x,
    double y,
}

void printCoords(Coordinate coord) {
    console.log("X is " + coord.x);
    console.log("Y is " + coord.y);
}

printCoords({ x: 37.2340392, y: 122.44361 });
```

A type alias can be used to name a union type.

```typescript
type ID = int | str;

void printLicensePlate( ID id ) {
    console.log("Your License plate is: " + id);
}
```

That's a better way to utilize union types in Tx.

### Interfaces

<br>

Interfaces are very similar to Type aliases, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable. [More about this here.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces)

A key difference in Tx is that you **should only use comma as the separator** and not semicolon in interfaces and type aliases.

```typescript
interface Coordinate = {
    double x, // not semicolon!
    double y,
}

void printCoords(Coordinate coord) {
    console.log("X is " + coord.x);
    console.log("Y is " + coord.y);
}

printCoords({ x: 37.2340392, y: 122.44361 });
```

### Literal types

When you (for some reason) want to have something like this:

```typescript
// This is TypeScript
let greetings: "hello" = "hello";
```

Then you have to use the TypeScript's syntax. Again, how dumb would ~~`"hello" greetings = "hello"`~~ looks?

On the other hand, combining literals into a type alias union work great:

```typescript
type RPS = "rock" | "paper" | "scissors";
}

void play(str player, RPS choice) {
    console.log(player + " chose " + choice);
}
play("Joey", "rock");
play("Yugi", "paper");
play("Kaiba", "Blue-Eyes White Dragon"); // Wrong
// Argument of type '"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"rock" | "paper" | "scissors"'
```

### Enums

<br>

Enums work just as they do in TypeScript.

```typescript
enum Colors {
  RED,
  BLUE,
  GREEN,
  YELLOW,
}
```

### Less common primitives

#### bigint

```typescript
// Creating a bigint via the BigInt function
const big oneHundred = BigInt(100);

// Creating a BigInt via the literal syntax
const big anotherHundred = 100n;
```

#### symbol

```typescript
const sym firstName = Symbol("name");
const sym secondName = Symbol("name");
```
